#### 1\. Core Foundations – First 8–12 months

(These are the mathematical muscles everything else will stand on)



##### Real Analysis (Kolmogorov) – Start early, but don’t rush. Do 3–5 hrs/week alongside programming—this will sharpen your mathematical maturity for all future topics.



##### Tensor Calculus (Taha Sochi) – After you’re halfway into Real Analysis, start this. It’s essential for relativity, QFT, and continuum mechanics.

##### 

##### PDE (Yehuda \& Jacob) – Since you’ve already done PDE basics in 2nd sem, focus here on physical applications \& numerical solving methods. Link it to coding projects (e.g., finite element solvers).

##### 

##### Stochastic Calculus (finance) – This can wait until you’ve got probability theory \& PDE more solid, so I’d keep it for later in Year 2.



#### 2\. Bridge to Applications – Months 12–20

(Blend math with computational science \& simulations)



##### Fluid Mechanics – Naturally connects to PDE + numerical simulation. You can combine it with OpenFOAM or Lattice Boltzmann projects.

##### 

##### Game Theory – Fits nicely alongside algorithmic work in game-dev AI, and also in modeling strategic behavior in simulations.

##### 

##### Math for Neural Networks (Bart Smets) – Slot this in as you start doing DL-related scientific computing—don’t treat it as a first-year priority.



#### 3\. Physics Mastery – Year 2 onward

(Once the math is strong, the physics will click deeper)



##### Quantum Mechanics (Sakurai) – You can start in parallel with Real Analysis if you keep the pace moderate. This will pair well with numerical methods in quantum simulation.

##### 

##### Quantum Field Theory (Lancaster \& Blundell) – Only after Sakurai is comfortable. Try to link to lattice QFT coding experiments.

##### 

##### Astronautics of Space Flight – This is lighter mathematically, so you can place it anywhere as a side project—especially when working on orbital simulations in game-dev.



Electrodynamics (Griffiths) – Since you’ve completed it, you can now apply it to simulation projects (Maxwell solver, particle tracing).



#### 4\. Meta \& Logic Layer – sprinkled throughout

(These help with proof thinking \& formal verification)



##### Notes on Metamathematics (Goldfarb) – Good as a 30–60 min/week side read to keep your logic brain active. This ties to temporal logic and formal methods in simulation verification.

##### 

##### Temporal Logic \& Computational Geometry –

##### 

##### Computational Geometry: Put it after your DSA core + maybe after your first simulation/game project—it’s highly useful in physics/game engines.

##### 

##### Temporal Logic: Place it when you’re doing modeling/simulation verification or formal methods (Year 2).
